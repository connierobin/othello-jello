I was a solo adventurer in this project. Perhaps I could have gone farther had I worked in a team, but I learned a lot in having to deal with my own knowledge gaps. 

My tournament submission is a humble but sturdy implementation of alpha-beta pruning. It scores boards purely on number of stones on the board, because ultimately that is how the score is determined. It goes down as many levels as it can (8) to determine the best way to proceed. This AI is no champion, but it is ready to be put to the test.
